I refused to title this post 'Hello World!', despite the temptation. It seems every blog starts with that one, and while that's not a bad thing, it felt a little too on the nose. However, I can't promise I won't go with something equally cliche in the future.

This new blog exists to capture my occasional urge to write about my exploits while working on various projects, or anything else that I feel strongly enough to write up a whole post about. Maybe someday I can reach the writing acumen of [Aphyr](https://aphyr.com/) and their beautiful prose, though I somehow doubt it.

If you want to know more about me, take a look at the [About Me](/about) page. If you want to take a look at some of the things I've worked on, take a look at [Projects](/projects)
